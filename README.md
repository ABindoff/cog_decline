### Modelling cognitive decline
#### using piece-wise regression models

Assume transition from normal cognitive function to cognitive decline, fit a piece-wise regression with a single break-point. The $\beta$ coefficient of the first segment should be $\approx 0$, and the $\beta$ coefficient of the second segment should be $< 0$.  


Various methods to estimate the break-point and select a model of transition from cognitively normal to cognitive decline are considered.
